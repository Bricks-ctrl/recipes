        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>700g potato, sliced</li>
            <li>400g sweet potato, sliced</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>1 red chilli, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 thumb-size piece ginger, grated</li>
            <li>1 tsp each ground cumin, coriander and garam masala</li>
            <li>pinch dried chilli flakes</li>
            <li>200g frozen pea</li>
            <li>juice 1 lemon, plus extra wedges to serve</li>
            <li>small bunch coriander, chopped</li>
            <li>25g butter, melted</li>
            <li>275g pack filo pastry</li>
            <li>Â½ tsp poppy seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Put the potatoes in a large saucepan of cold, salted water, then bring to the boil. Turn down and simmer for 5 mins, add the sweet potatoes and continue to cook for 8 mins until just tender.</li>
          <li>Fry the onion in the oil until soft, add the cumin seeds for 1 min, then stir in the garlic, chilli and ginger with the remaining spices. Cook for a further 2-3 mins, then turn off the heat and stir into the potatoes with the peas, lemon juice and coriander.</li>
          <li>Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Halve the filo sheets, and use two-thirds of them, overlapping, to line a 22cm loose-bottomed cake tin with a little overhang. As you lay in each sheet, brush with melted butter and keep the rest covered with a clean tea towel. Spoon in filling and press down lightly. Cover with remaining filo, then fold up overhanging sides and scrunch up pastry near the edges.</li>
          <li>Poke several slits in the top of the pastry and brush with more butter. Sprinkle with the poppy seeds. Bake for 40-45 mins until golden brown. Serve either hot or at room temperature with lemon wedges.</li>
        </ol>
